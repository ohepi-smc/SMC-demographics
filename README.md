Federal law [13 U.S.C. §§ 8 and 9] requires the Census Bureau to publish data in a manner that does not permit use of the data alone, or in combination with other available information, to identify any particular respondent to a Census Bureau survey. The identification of a person or establishment or disclosure of information collected from that person or establishment in the course of a Census Bureau survey violates the assurances of confidentiality provided by federal law.
The Census Bureau has created these data to exclude information that would directly identify respondents and characteristics that may lead to the identification of respondents.  The Census Bureau provides these data to facilitate statistical research and analysis.
Therefore, users will not use these data, alone or in combination with any other Census or non-Census data, to identify any individual person, household, business or other entity; not link or combine these data with information in any other Census or non-Census dataset in a manner that identifies an individual person, household, business or other entity; not publish information from these data files, particularly in combination with any other Census or non-Census data, in a manner that identifies any individual person, household, business or other entity; and not use the  identity of any person or establishment discovered inadvertently and advise the Director of the Census Bureau of any such discovery by calling the U.S. Census Bureau’s Policy Coordination Office at 301-763-6440.

Population estimates produced by the Department of Finance are mandated by the California Constitution and various codes. They are used by state agencies, California counties, academic institutions, private research organizations, the media, and the public. Primary uses include budgeting, needs assessment, program planning and evaluation, distribution of state funds, and the calculation of rates (such as birth, death, and incarceration). Population estimates are developed using aggregate data from a variety of sources, including birth and death counts provided by the Department of Public Health, number of driver's licenses and driver’s license address change data from the Department of Motor Vehicles, housing unit data from local governments, school enrollment data from the Department of Education, and federal income tax return data from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. These statistical reports of administrative records do not disclose any information about individuals. County ranking tables, maps, and the E-2 (California County Population Estimates and Components of Change by Year, July 1, 2010-2017) methodology and data tables are included. The E-2 and companion reports E-6 (Population Estimates and Components of Change by County, July 1, 2010-2017) and E-7 (California Population Estimates, with Components of Change and Crude Rates, July 1, 1900-2017), are on the Department's website.
